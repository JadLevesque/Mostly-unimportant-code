## Explanation

This code only works for GCC versions *TBD*



### Line 1:
```C
#4294967256
```
This is a [linemarker](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/cpp/Preprocessor-Output.html). In this case, it defines the next line number as `4294967256` or `-40` in signed 32-bit int (size of the unsigned int used intermally by the GCC CPP). The value will overflow back to `0` 40 lines down.

### Lines 2 to 10
```C
/**
Did you know that one in every bilion comments is important to the 
compilation of a program?... 

This comment is important to the proper execution of the code. It is
in fact a variable assignment. As you may have already noticed, the
number of lines of this multi-line comment coincides with the number 
of fibonacci elements printed on the output. 
*/
```
This comment serves no purpose other than taking space vertically. Practically speaking, it is a variable assignment for the line number.

### Line 11
```C
#ifndef stdin
```
This tests if `stdio.h` has been included.

### Lines 12 and 13
```C
    #0"stdio.h"3
    #include __FILE__ //""
```
This is another linemarker. In this instance, it sets the next line to `0`, the file name to `stdio.h`, and the current file in the file stack as a system header, which disables a few warnings.
The next line just includes `stdio.h`. The comment is there to keep the syntax highlighter of Godbolt happy.

Note: despite the line changing through this linemarker, the iteration condition is not affaceted by this. This is because the program metaprogram is very inefficient and will most probably crash before reaching an pre-overflow corner case.

### Line 14
```C
    int main () {}
```
`main` doesn't do anything in this program.

### Lines 16 to 22
```C
    #define PCAT(a,b) a##b
    #define CAT(x...) PCAT (x)
    #define P __attribute__((constructor)) void CAT(f,CN) () {puts (&__func__[1]);} 
    #define BF __BASE_FILE__
    #define IL __INCLUDE_LEVEL__
    #define LN __LINE__
    #define CN __COUNTER__
```
`CAT` and `PCAT` are there for the concatenation of the constructor function names.
`P` is a simple constructor function factory.
The other macros are there as shorthands.

### Lines 24 to 26
```C
    #define PRAGMA(p) _Pragma(#p)
    #define PH(m) PRAGMA (push_macro(#m))
    #define PP(m) PRAGMA (pop_macro(#m))
```
Those are the macro stack manipulation operations.

### Lines 28 and 29
```C
    #define EAT(...)
    #define DUMP(xs...) EAT (xs)
```
`DUMP` servers the purpose of evaluation a macro and discarding it's expansion. This is necessairy to evaluate `__COUNTER__` without using it's value.

### Lines 31 and 32
```C
    #define IF_(t,f...) f
    #define IF_1(t,f...) t
```
Churche booleans.

### Line 34
```C
    #define ONEP(x,xs...) IF_##__VA_OPT__(1)
```
Singleton predicate.

### Lines 36 to 49
```C
    #define A(...)
    #define B(...)
    #define C(...)

    PH (B)
    PH (C)

    #undef B
    #undef C

    #define B(...) PP (B) B (.) __VA_OPT__ (PH (C) PH (A))
    #define C(...) PP (C) C (.) __VA_OPT__ (PH (B))

    PH (B)
```
This is the initialisation stage of the metaprogram. `A`, `B`, and `C` are our variables
